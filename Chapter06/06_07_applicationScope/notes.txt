The web is a stateless function, meaning each request is a
UNIQUE transaction. We cannot pass data from one request to the next.
ColdFusion gets around this by using persistent scopes

- Persistent scopes persist across requests

The application scope is available throughout the entire application
It is activated by setting the application name in the .cfc file

The Application scope
    - is seen across entire Application
    - every single file in the app has access to the same application scope
    - the application scope persists across requests

If both applications have the same name; 
- they share the same scope, so use unique names always

The application timeout:
- The application scope is populated when the first request hits the application
- The scope is discarded, when the timeout is reached
- default timeout can be set in the CF Admin
