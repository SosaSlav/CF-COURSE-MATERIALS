    - cookies are client variables because they are managed by the browser
(NOT THE CF SERVER)

Finding the Session scope
- when a request hits the cf SERVER
    - CF checks for the CFID and the CFTOKEN cookies in the incoming request
        - If yes: CF uses the value of the CFID and the CFTOKEN cookies to match the request with an existing session
        - If no: CF generates a new session and saves the session identifiers as cookies on the client browser, so this data is available on the next request from that browser
